# SVM-Classification


To predict protein signal peptides, two algorithms, VonHeijn and SVM, were trained.

We found the hyperparameter of SVM method by 5-fold cross validation and then we applied on the blind dataset. The final results are as following:

SVM outperformed VonHeijn with an MCC of 0.7466 and F1 score of 0.7438, compared to VonHeijn's MCC of 0.5905 and F1 score of 0.5909.
